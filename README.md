Sendero Hardware
================

In this repository you will find the Eagle files to build the Bondibar LED Driver PCB and a NodeMCU V2 ESP-12E DevKit dongle PCB to ease the connection between them.

The Bondibar is a LED Strip driver using WS2801.

The Bondibar uses standard USB cables to daisychain data transmission, IRF520 high power transistors to power up up to 8 LED strips per PCB, and it can also daisychain power from one Bondibar to another. It also is capable of supplying power for the NodeMCUV2 through the USB connector.

The Bondibar was designed by Pablo Gindel (http://www.pablogindel.com) in 2013-2014 and modified for USB port power supply in 2016.

Here are some images of these components.
